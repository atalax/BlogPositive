Building
====
To build, run `make && make plugins && make bindcatalogs`. This will make the app and bind the language catalogs into it. Afterwards just run it! (Also, move the add-ons folder into the folder the app is if you move it!)

Translate!
====
You can help by translating the app into your language! Just copy the catalog, fill it in and send a pull request.

Languages done:

 - English
 - Dutch
