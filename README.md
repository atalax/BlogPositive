Notice

At the moment, will 99% sure not build. Do not try to fix, I'm fixing it in the GCI task: https://google-melange.appspot.com/gci/task/view/google/gci2013/5813166428651520

Building
====
To build, run `jam`. If it is your first time, run `jam` again. After that, just run `./obj.X86/BlogPositive`!

Disclaimer

Only tested with GCC2-hybrid on x86.
